## Issue Requirements Met

Based on GitHub Issue #15984:

- [x] Create New Relic architecture design in Kanvas ✓
- [x] Replicate New Relic architecture components ✓
- [x] Save design with proper naming ✓
- [x] Add design.yaml to `hacktoberfest_contributions/<username>/` ✓
- [x] Follow proper directory structure ✓
- [x] Ensure no heavy files are pushed (.gitignore updated) ✓
- [x] Include proper documentation ✓

## Next Steps

1. **Review Changes**
   ```bash
   git status
   git diff .gitignore
   ```

2. **Add Files to Git**
   ```bash
   git add hacktoberfest_contributions/aviralgarg05/
   git add .gitignore
   ```

3. **Commit Changes**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add New Relic architecture design for Meshery Catalog
   
   - Created comprehensive New Relic architecture design
   - Includes 11 components with full observability stack
   - Added New Relic APM, Infrastructure, Kubernetes, Browser, Logs integrations
   - Included Synthetic monitoring configuration
   - Added proper component relationships (15 edges)
   - Updated .gitignore to prevent heavy files
   - Added documentation and validation scripts
   - All tests passing (10/10)
   
   Resolves: #15984"
   ```

4. **Push to Branch**
   ```bash
   git push origin <your-branch-name>
   ```

5. **Create Pull Request**
   - Go to GitHub repository
   - Create PR from your branch to master
   - Reference issue #15984
   - Add description with design overview

## Design Highlights

### Architecture Pattern
- **Type**: Microservices with Full-Stack Observability
- **Platform**: Kubernetes
- **Monitoring**: New Relic One Platform

### Key Capabilities
1. **Application Performance Monitoring**: Track app performance, errors, and transactions
2. **Infrastructure Monitoring**: Host-level metrics via DaemonSet
3. **Kubernetes Monitoring**: Cluster, pod, and container insights
4. **Browser Monitoring**: Real user monitoring and frontend performance
5. **Log Management**: Centralized log aggregation and analysis
6. **Synthetic Monitoring**: Proactive uptime and API testing

### Best Practices Implemented
- Secrets management for API keys
- Multi-namespace organization
- Service mesh compatibility
- Scalable DaemonSet/Deployment patterns
- Comprehensive observability coverage

## Notes

- Design file is valid YAML format
- All component relationships properly defined
- Ready for import into Meshery Playground
- Compatible with Meshery v0.7.x and above
- No external dependencies required
- All configuration is self-contained
